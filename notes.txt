 - start at intro

 - find the best place for the drop
     - best - loudest most mechanical section
        - try - loudest phrase or second to last phrase
     - second - loudest, most confident beats
 - force a transition to 'drop-intro' at N beats before drop



graph:

1) Load library.js as quantum
2) Schedule a simple on the beat pattern
3) Add on off-beat in a separate voice
4) write pattern scheduler:
    
    should offer varied sequences
    supports varied voices
    supports the drop. (extra, can we stop the main audio to support the drop
    Create an animation
    Make it look nice, add some puns
